Yet another library to timestretch audio on the browser.

The focus of this implementaion is to make the code easy to understand. There will be examples of how to:

- Pitchshift an audio buffer
- Perform pitchshifting using a webworker
- Realtime pitchshifting of an audio source

This is not the best implementation if you're looking for sound quality and/or performance (see FAQ).

__This is work in progress__

## (FA)Q

__Are other implementations available?__

Yes, some of them:
- https://github.com/sebpiq/paulstretch.js
- https://github.com/echo66/OLA-TS.js
- https://github.com/echo66/PhaseVocoderJS
- https://github.com/Infinity/Kali
- https://github.com/0xfe/vexwarp
- https://github.com/mikolalysenko/pitch-shift
- https://github.com/GTCMT/pitchshiftjs

And there are probably more...

__Which one should I use?__

I don't know by experiencie, but [@echo66](https://github.com/echo66) projects looks promising.

__Then, why?__

Because I want to learn.
